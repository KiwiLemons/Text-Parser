# Text-Parser
A text utility that can get text between two pieces of text. I want to make it pretty robust and able to handle lots of situations. I also know that the title text parser isn't exactly correct but I don't know what to call it.
# Usage
I've made an example button that should show how to use the program. Also if you hover over controls I've added a tip to controls I think are not super self explanatory
# Plans
* Improve the handling of errors in a recursive parse
* Make it look better
  * I don't want to use a different GUI framework but I want to just make it look less cluttered
* Add more comments to explain things
* Add creatable presets so you don't have to redo the same thing over and over
